Mini Blog Platform

A simple blog backend built with Java + Spring Boot.
This is a learning project where I'm building out a blog platform from scratch, starting with core backend features and expanding into Docker, Kubernetes, and security as I go.

Features so far
- User registration
- Post creation with Markdown support
- REST API
- H2 in-memory database (easy to reset during development)

In Progress
- Add comments to posts
- Switch from H2 to PostgreSQL
- Podman + podman-compose setup
- JWT login with Spring Security
- Basic frontend
- Kubernetes deployment
